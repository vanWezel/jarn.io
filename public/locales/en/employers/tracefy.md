At Tracefy I worked at the further development of the fleet management system. With the focus on organisations that have a fleet of (small) vehicles. Think of bicycles, scooters and even cars. These vehicles are often used for delivery such as Thuisbezorgd.nl or rental like GO Sharing. The fleet management system I worked on ensures that customers know whether their fleet is being used optimally. For example, updates are shared via the software such as the location of the vehicle and when maintenance is required. This way, customers can manage their fleet more efficiently and provide the best possible service.
