Due to the rapid growth of Tracefy, real-time updates were no longer possible on older devices. The data set had become too large. As a solution, I designed and developed a new service in Node.js. This service ensures that the update from a location is sent to various front-end applications. When it first went into production, we were dealing with over 2000 locations on the map.

At one point, so many locations were added that it took more than 10 seconds to load. So I updated it by developing and adding two new services. One of the services stored the last known locations in a Redis database. The other only stored the necessary information of a bike in a DynamoDB table. With my solution I was able to reduce 10 seconds of load time to 1.5 seconds for more than 4100 locations.
